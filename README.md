# Fuzzy logic system on GPU(=Graphics Programming Units) using CUDA
What if decision is not always a clear case? What if we want a range in how far we execute a certain behaviour?
The answer to these questions are Fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic allows us to cope with gray areas. (Book: AI for Games p371)

## Conclusion/Future work
Why fuzzy logic insn't such a staple in the academic AI community is because it's always better to use probability to represent any kind of uncertainty.
The reason behind this is that any kind of flaw in another theory of uncertainty, besides probability theory, can potentially be exploited by an opponent, which in games you absoletuly want avoid. (Book: AI for Games p.371)

This is why it's interesting to look further into Markov systems and the usage of Bayes nets. As Bayes nets make probalistic methods faster. (Book: AI for Games p.371)
